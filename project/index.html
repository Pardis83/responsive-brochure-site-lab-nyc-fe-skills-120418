	  <h2>What is the Northern Lights?</h2>
		The Northern Lights are often referred to as Aurora Borealis, which is the latin name. Aurora Borealis, "morning red in the north‚Äù, is said to originate from Galileo Galilei. The Northern Lights have fascinated people through the years, with beautiful color on the night sky. Northern Lights comes from explosions from the sun which causes large amounts of electrically charged particles to be dispensed into outer space. 

The particles are electrons and protons that form light when they collide with the gases in the earth's atmosphere. Although the northern lights are created by scientific conditions, there are also many exciting myths and stories. In Norse mythology, the magic phenomenon was described as a colorful bridge connecting heaven and earth.

 	   <h2> Norway is the best place to see the Northern Lights</h2>
 		The Northern Lights can be observed along the coast of Northern Norway where you are perfectly positioned to observe this phenomenon. Coincidentally, Northern Norway is also the place in the world with the most exposure of Northern Lights. The further away from the big cities, the better. People from all over the world travel to the cold winter in Norway to see nature's most spectacular light show. 

Due to the unstable weather in Norway, we can never give a Northern Lights guarantee, but you can keep yourself updated on the Northern Lights forecast. This measures the activity on the sun's surface on a scale from one to nine. The higher the number, the bigger chance of seeing the light.

<h2>Best time to visit</h2>
	When people think about the Northern Lights, they often think about the winter. It isn't only in the winter you can spot the light, but as long as the sky is dark you can see the Northern Lights several times. The Northern Lights are far beyond the clouds, so when the weather is clear, we see the nature at its best. It is difficult to predict which month is better than others, but from September to the end of March you have a pretty good chance of seeing the Aurora Dance. 

   At the Aurora Borealis Observatory we can see the Aurora Dance approximately around August 19th to April 15th. When darkness falls, the chase of the northern lights begins. Between 9 pm and 2 am, close to midnight, you see the Northern Lights best. It can take many hours before you see it, so you must have patience. If it's a full moon as well, you'll get the best pictures.
